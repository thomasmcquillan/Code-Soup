                Each Make/Use garment made in this method is unique to both the fabric and the user. The length of a
                Make/Use Long Tshirt can be altered to suit an individual's height or taste; a favourite fabric can be used
                to make the Long Tshirt and drastically alter its appearance; new iterations can be created by combining
                templates in ways dreamt up by the maker/user. The possibilities are literally endless.

                <li>Measure on your body the desired depth of sleeve (B) from your own shoulder down - this begins
